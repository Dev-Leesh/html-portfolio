<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Alisha Karim and I'm currently 19 years old. I am a college student and aspiring web developer. I come from a biracial background with my mom being Dominican and my dad being Bengali. 
  Growing up exposed to these two cultures has allowed me to appreciate a plethora
   of the other cultures this world has to offer. This mindset is one that I carry with me in many aspects
   of life. I enjoy meeting new people, trying new things, exploring places not yet known to me,
   and much more.   
</p>

<p> As I write this (on 12/31/2023), I am a Sophomore at NYIT and have just completed my third 
  semester in the pursuit of a Bachelors degree in Computer Sciece. I wasn't always into Computer Science and in fact, I was originally on the path of 
being Pre-Med and even majored in Biological Sciences at Brooklyn Technical High School. But, after acknowledging
this hunger I have for solving, whether it be problems or thinking outside the box, I realized Pre-Med is simply not for me. 
After discussing this dilemma with my dad, he mentioned I should look into Computer Science 
because I excell in math, logic, and sciences. And, well, the rest is history.   </p>

<p> Upon the completion of my Bachelors, I hope to be a part of a company in the Medical field that positively 
  impacts the world. I feel it is my life's purpose to help people and alleviate the burden 
  that people, specifically medically ill individuals, face on a day-to-day basis. However, my greatest goal 
  is to have launched the inventions that I have in mind or better yet, have my own successful startup. Ultimately, all I can do 
  is work hard and do my part in making this happen.
