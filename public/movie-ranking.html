<h1>Alisha's Top Movie Picks </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time are:  </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>This movie made me aware of how every decision we make will affect the trajectory of our future, no matter how big or small those decisions are.</p>
<h3>Armageddon </h3>
<p>This movie has such a heartwarming ending about a father's love for his daughter. </p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Beautiful film. The ending made me wonder about the possibility that this can happen in the real world. I.e, divine intervention.</p>
