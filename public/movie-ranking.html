<h1>Alisha's Top Movie Picks </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time are:  </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>This made me aware of how every decision we make affects the trajectory of our future.</p>
<h3>Armageddon </h3>
<p>This movie had such a heartwarming ending about a father's love for his daughter. </p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Beautiful film. The ending made me think if that outcome rings true about the real world..i.e God's Plan</p>
